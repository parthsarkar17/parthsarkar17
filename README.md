Hi, Iâ€™m Parth! I'm a sophomore at Cornell University, and I'm majoring in Math and Computer Science. I'm passionate about artificial intelligence, climate
change, politics, and cooking!

I'm currently learning about the applications of deep learning methods into personalized drug discovery with my summer research at Hunter College CUNY. I'm
also interested in applications into computer vision and natural language processing.

You can reach me at: ps679@cornell.edu.

Thanks!
